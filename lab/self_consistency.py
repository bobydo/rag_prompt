# Self-consistency: The model solves a problem multiple independent ways, 
# then compares the answers to select the most consistent and reliable result.
# Benefit: Encourages critical thinking and verification, 
# improving accuracy for complex decision-making (e.g., testing the sisterâ€™s age problem through three separate calculations).
